This post is a quick summary of the basic research I've done for my stock price estimation project.

## What affects stock prices?

Stock market prices are mainly driven by supply and demand. Some of the key factors influencing this include:

- **Company fundamentals:** earnings, revenue, financial health
- **Macroeconomic factors:** interest rates, inflation, job reports, etc.
- **Sentiment analysis:** how people react on social media or in the news
- **Technical patterns:** RSI, moving averages, and other indicators

## Current Idea

Right now, I believe that:

- **Company fundamentals** might already be reflected in past price data.
- **Macroeconomic factors** could be indirectly captured through sentiment in news or social media.

So, my current plan is to build a price estimation model using:
- **Price history**
- **Sentiment analysis** from news articles or platforms like Twitter

## Going Forward

As I study more, I’ll keep posting what I learn here. This will include ideas, mistakes, changes in direction, or anything useful that comes up.
